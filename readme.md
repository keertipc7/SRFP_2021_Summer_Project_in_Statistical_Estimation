# Methods of Estimation in Statistics

Repository for Project through Summer Reseach Fellowship Programme-2021.

## Project Report

The complete project report, which is a chronological summary of everything learnt, discussed and worked upon, is stored in **Project_Report.pdf** file.

## Codes

The **Codes** folder of this repository contains all the codes which were written to implement various algorithms. The problem statement and other required information regarding these codes is available in the *"Codes and Outputs"* section of the project report.

## Meeting Notes

All the problems, algorithms, theories and proofs discussed during the weekly meetings with my guide, Prof. Anil Kumar Ghosh, are available in the **Meeting_Notes.pdf** file. 

## Self Notes
Weekly tasks given to me during the fellowship and my project related self learning are all noted down in **Self_Notes.pdf** file. 

*Note: All the methods, algorithms and problems that are briefly explained in the **Project_Report.pdf** are explained in depth in  **Meeting_Notes.pdf** and **Self_Notes.pdf** files. The algorithms and their respective examples that have been mentioned in **Project_Report.pdf** have been coded out and stored in **Codes** folder.*
